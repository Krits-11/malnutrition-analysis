1. Project Overview

This project investigates child malnutrition in India using NFHS-5 data, focusing on three core indicators—Stunting, Underweight, and Wasting.
Through exploratory data analysis, correlation mapping, and visual storytelling, the study examines how maternal health, women’s education, child-feeding practices, and household infrastructure influence nutritional outcomes.
The goal is to uncover data-driven insights and understand the socio-economic and health determinants of child malnutrition.
